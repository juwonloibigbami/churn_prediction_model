**Churn Prediction Model**
Predict customer churn using various machine learning algorithms in Python.

**Overview**
This project implements and compares several machine learning models to predict customer churn in a banking dataset. The aim is to identify which algorithm offers the best performance for this classification task.

**Features**
Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

**Model training and evaluation using:**

RandomForestClassifier

LogisticRegression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

GradientBoostingClassifier

KNeighborsClassifier

Performance metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

**Dataset**
The project uses the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset, which contains customer data from a bank, including:

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Geography)

Account information (CreditScore, Balance, Tenure, Number of Products)

Activity indicators (HasCrCard, IsActiveMember)

Target variable: Exited (1 if the customer left, 0 otherwise)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Install Dependencies
Install required Python libraries:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Running the Notebook
Clone this repository:

**bash**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction-model.git
cd churn-prediction-model
Open churn_prediction_model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or upload to Google Colab.

Ensure the dataset is available at data/Churn_Modelling.csv.

Run all cells to execute the analysis and view results.

**Usage**
Modify the notebook to experiment with different features or algorithms.

Use the evaluation metrics to compare model performance.

Adapt the code for your own churn prediction use cases.

**Results**
The notebook evaluates each model and provides metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report. This allows you to select the best algorithm for your application.
